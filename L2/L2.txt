Collecting a corpus
1. Collect a corpus of at least 750,000 words. You will check the number of words using the Unix command wc -w.
2. Alternatively, you can retrieve a corpus of novels by Selma Lagerlöf from this URL: http://fileadmin.cs.lth.se/cs/Education/EDAN20/corpus/Selma.txt.
3. Run the concordance program to print the lines containing a specific word, for instance Nils.
4. Run the tokenization program on your corpus and count the words using the Unix sort and uniq commands.

Answer:
Retrieved Selma.txt as corpus. Number of words using wc -w Selma.txt was 965392. Ran concordance program. Ran tokenization program (modified), counted words using Unix sort and uniq as such:
python3 tokenizer.py < Selma.txt
sort tokens.txt | uniq -c

Normalizing a corpus
1. Write a program to insert <s> and </s> tags to delimit sentences. You can start from the tokenization and modify it. Use a simple heuristics such as: a sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a period. Estimate roughly the accuracy of your program.
2. Modify your program to remove the punctuation signs and set all the text in lower case letters.
3. The result should be a normalized text without punctuation signs where all the sentences are delimited with <s> and </s> tags.
4. The five last lines of the text should look like this:
    <s> hon hade fått större kärlek av sina föräldrar än någon annan han visste och sådan kärlek måste vändas i välsignelse </s>
    <s> när prästen sa detta kom alla människor att se bort mot klara gulla och de förundrade sig över vad de såg </s>
    <s> prästens ord tycktes redan ha gått i uppfyllelse </s>
    <s> där stod klara fina gulleborg ifrån skrolycka hon som var uppkallad efter själva solen vid sina föräldrars grav och lyste som en förklarad </s>
    <s> hon var likaså vacker som den söndagen då hon gick till kyrkan i den röda klänningen om inte vackrare </s>

Answer:
Done. See normalize.py.

Counting unigrams and bigrams
1. Read and try programs to compute the frequency of unigrams and bigrams of the training set: [Program folder].
Answer:
python3 count.py < Selma.txt
python3 count_bigrams.py < Selma.txt
2. What is the possible number of bigrams and their real number? Explain why such a difference. What would be the possible number of 4-grams.
Answer:
Possible number is [nr words - 1] if no repeating bigrams. Real number of bigrams in Selma.txt is 319877. Possible number of 4-grams would then be [nr words - 3].
3. Propose a solution to cope with bigrams unseen in the corpus. This topic will be discussed during the lab session.

Computing the likelihood of a sentence
1. Write a program to compute a sentence's probability using unigrams.
2. Write a program to compute the sentence probability using bigrams.
3. Select five sentences in your test set and run your programs on them.
4. Tabulate your results as in the examples below with the sentence "Det var en gång en katt som hette Nils"

Answer:
Done. See likelihood.py
